    2) As a user I want everything to be light and well structured so nothing is slow and heavy.

    4) As a user I want the display to respond to new changes.
    5) As a user I want to be able to sign out.

5) By splitting up my program into multiple modules so it's spaced out and not as overwhelming to

7) By committing my changes every half hour that I work on my project.
