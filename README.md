PLANNING STORY
First created my wireframe to have my project and ideas laid out. Laying out proper folders were where I started, working through events and getting api and ui set up.
Any problems that came up were solved fairly quickly  with research and breaking down the issues into smaller parts and working through them.

USER STORIES
1) With good clear HTML structure, well thought out CSS for a pretty and easy to read layout, and JQuery event listeners.

2) By thinking about each piece carefully and developing a plan before even getting started.

3) {
    1) As a user I want to be able to sign up and sign in.
    2) As a user I want everything to be light and well structured so nothing is slow and heavy.
    3) As a user I want to pay special attention to CSS and HTML so design is unique and memoriable.     
    4) As a user I want the display to respond to new changes.
    5) As a user I want to be able to sign out.
}

4) By splitting up my program into multiple modules so it's spaced out and not as overwhelming to 
    work on. By create specific files that hold correlating code so they're easy to access, find and read.

5) I think it could be fun to find a way to use something other than X's and O's as playing pieces. 

6) By committing my changes every half hour that I work on my project. 

7) I would like to add a few cute animations for when the game is won
