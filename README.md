## Planning Story

This was my very first front-end project, so I took great pride in planning this out, creating it, and finally seeing it work. First deciding how it should look, then take deep thought about what all functions I would like for this game to have, and what all the user should be able to do with it. I will list out every action I feel a user would want and expect from a small application like this in my User Stories, and use those as a guide for building my game. Once I have those in mind, I will create my wireframe, being sure to keep it clean and clear to navigate through, as well as carefully considering how each function of the Game should work and be displayed. 

Finally I will begin working on my code, first setting up all folders that will communicate with the server for the users email and password and make sure that they are stored. My plan is to then use BootStrap to make my GameBoard, as well as add in all buttons and input forms inside of HTML for a bit of structuring. I plan on using different pages to keep all authentication separate and from the actual game as that will keep all current screens organized and uncluttered. I plan on using JQuery for all Event Listeners, For Loops to iterate through win/lose/draw scenarios, and UI messages for displaying all success and or failure progress.

I plan to carefully study and break down all issues that arise, giving myself time to work through each one and use internet resources to help me problem solve and debug for future projects. To prevent code loss I plane to commit and pucs frequently, and in the end, make sure that my console is clear of any logs and errors.
